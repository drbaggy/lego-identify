# Identifying lego parts

## Helping others help you...

 * Don't put too many parts/mini-build on the same photo - keep it nice and simple - and make sure everything is clear and in focus. Sometimes the smallest detail is important in identifying a part! And lay them out in a grid or number them... It is easier to day #1 or top-left than "the red one between the green one and the blue one"!

 * When you are getting us to help you - take multiple photos from different - the "keystone" may be somewhere underneath or on the side to help identify the chunk of LEGO.

 * If you are photographing bags - try and use light such that you don't get glare or have to use the flash on your phone but still can see the parts...

 * Finally your tartan rug may be beautiful - but can make identifying parts harder!

 * If the part doesn't have studs - it can help to put a 2x4 or 2x8 plate beside it to give people the idea of scale...

 * For minifig accessories - fit it in the hand of a minifig - if it doesn't fit it is unlikely to be LEGO.

## For finding parts:

The dimensions of the part are really helpful! But it's important to get them the right way around or Bricklink won't find anything:

 * Bricks, Plates and Tiles tend to be the shortest side followed by the longest side
 * Slopes and Wedges tend to use the dimension going away from the interesting bit (the end of the slope/wedge) followed by across
 * Panels, Doors, Windows etc plus anything that isn't 1 brick tall - remember that height can't be measured using studs as bricks are 1.2x taller than wide. To find the height, stack some standard bricks up until it matches.

*If you don't seem to be getting what you're expecting, try reversing the dimensions in case you have them the wrong way around.*

You can set the base colour of the part in the advanced options, this will narrow down your search results. On the search page there is "More Options" underneath the Search button, click this and then there will be a drop-down for colour. Be careful with similar colours though, such as gray and brown. If you're not sure on the colour either try them all or skip this bit.

For finding printed/stickered parts I find it much easier to find the part number of the plain part first, and then search for the part number plus an asterisk on the end. So in your example the part number for a 2x2 slope is `3039`, so you would search `3039*`

Again, you can set the base colour of the part in the advanced options, this will narrow down your search results.

You can add keywords onto the end of the search as well, this often works well with any text that is on the part. I recommend that you don't add more than one at a time as if anything is wrong you won't find what you want. For some colours you might not need to add any keywords at all as they are not common.

### An example:

 * Finding the 2x2 slope - https://www.bricklink.com/v2/search.page?q=2x2%20slope...
 * Finding printed parts on a red 2x2 slope (in this case there aren't many results, so no keywords required!) - https://www.bricklink.com/v2/search.page?q=3039*&color=5&rpp=100&tab=P#T=P
 * Do be aware that the Bricklink search will only find printed/stickered parts that have already been submitted to Bricklink, some of them are missing.

### Notes

 * You can use a "`*`" as a wild card so search for say "`Snake*`" will pick up both "Snake" and "Snakes" which can be useful for searching for stickers.
 * One way to identify torsos is to use the colour of the arms/hands (if they are unprinted) - use "Appears in multiple" and look for arms (982 - right arm) and hands (983) and restrict to "minifigs" to cut your search space - obviously yellow/flesh it is less useful... - If the right arm is printed you can use 981 - left arm (as you look at minifig)

## Finding something made up of multiple parts from a single set.

To find something made up of multiple parts - e.g. a small chunk of a bricks together - or a bag - you can use the "appears in" option at the top of the parts page.

 * Here - start with "rare" parts or colours - these will reduce the search space.
 * Choose pieces of different colours if you can - be aware of the issues that Gemma said about similar colours (easier if you are looking at the piece yourself and can compare against pieces of known colour - some photos make it really difficult!)
 * If you have grey/black/red say it is more likely to hone in on an answer than choosing say grey/grey/grey...

### Caveats
 * 3-in-1's or Technic with B-models you may find that the pieces don't appear in the main picture for a set....
 * Mixels were designed to be mixed and so you may find pieces which are made up of multiple mixel sets...
 * You may find that a pile of bricks has a few "rogue" bits added to it - so try different combinations of 3 parts to match!
 * Watch out for parts which have different moulds - like clips - they may be best to be avoided unless you can clearly identify which particular variant you have

## Finally some thoughts:

 * Occam's Razor... if you find a piece from 1 set - and you find a piece that is in a few different sets - then it is more likely to be from the set you have just found...
 * Related - if you find a small chunk of a set or a minifig - look to see if you may have other pieces of it - this will often save you time...!
 * Even if not the same set - if you have a big lot of Star Wars LEGO then another piece is slightly more likely to be from a Star Wars set than another theme...
